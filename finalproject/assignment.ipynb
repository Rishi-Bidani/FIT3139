    "### Identify the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary problem addressed in this project is to understand the impact of skill distribution on player rankings in a tennis season. Additionally, the project aims to determine whether longer matches or longer seasons are more effective in revealing the true quality of players. This problem is motivated by the need to ensure fairness and accuracy in competitive sports, where ranking systems often determine players' career opportunities, financial rewards, and public recognition.\n",

    "#### Points:\n",
    "Each game starts with a serve and players alternate serving every game. Points are scored as follows: 0 (Love), 15, 30, 40, and game point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Games:\n",
    "A player wins a game by scoring four points and leading by at least two points. If the score reaches 40-40, the game is in deuce, and a player must win two consecutive points to win the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sets:\n",
    "A player wins a set by winning six games and leading by at least two games. If the score reaches 6-6, a tiebreaker is played to determine the winner of the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Match:\n",
    "A player wins a match by winning the best of three or five sets.\n",
